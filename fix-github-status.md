# Fix GitHub Status Check (Red X) Problem

## The red X on GitHub is likely caused by Vercel integration issues. Here's how to fix it:

### Method 1: Reconnect Vercel to GitHub

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project**: `FastDeliverySite`
3. **Go to Settings** → **Git**
4. **Disconnect GitHub** (if connected)
5. **Reconnect GitHub** and select your repository
6. **Redeploy** the project

### Method 2: Check Vercel Deployment Status

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Check if your latest commit is deployed**
3. **Look for any error messages** in the deployment logs
4. **If there are errors, fix them and redeploy**

### Method 3: Force GitHub Status Update

1. **Make a small change** to any file (like this README)
2. **Commit and push** the change
3. **This will trigger a new status check**

### Method 4: Check GitHub Repository Settings

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Settings** → **Branches**
3. **Check if there are any branch protection rules** causing the red X
4. **Settings** → **Integrations & services**
5. **Check Vercel integration status**

### Method 5: Manual Vercel Deployment

If GitHub integration is not working:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Click "Deploy"** on your project
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub"**
4. **Choose your repository and branch**
5. **Deploy manually**

## Expected Result:
- ✅ Red X should turn into green checkmark
- ✅ Vercel deployment should show as successful
- ✅ GitHub status checks should pass

## If Still Not Working:
The issue might be:
- Vercel account limits
- GitHub repository permissions
- Network/firewall issues
- Vercel service outage

Try the methods above in order, and the red X should disappear!
